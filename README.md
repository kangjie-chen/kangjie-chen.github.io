A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

I think I've got things running smoothly and fixed some major bugs, but feel free to file issues or make pull requests if you want to improve the generic template / theme.

### Note: if you are using this repo and now get a notification about a security vulnerability, delete the Gemfile.lock file.

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above
2. Install Ruby and Ruby DevKit from https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
3. *run the following commands in the windows-terminal*, not the vscode terminal. I do not know why this is necessary.
3. Install Jekyll and Bundler by running `gem install jekyll` in a command prompt
4. Run `bundle clean` to clean up the directory (no need to run `--force`) 
5. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
6. Run `bundle exec jekyll liveserve -o` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change. (-o means open pages automatically)
